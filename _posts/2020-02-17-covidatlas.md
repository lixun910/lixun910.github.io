lead_text: "I am the author and one of the three leaders of the US Covid Atlas project. The US Covid atlas is a web app for county-level COVID-19 estimates, longitudinal exploration, and statistical cluster detection. It reveals a more detailed pandemic landscape with local hotspots of surging COVID cases that are missed by state-level data. The core spatial analysis functions were written in C++ to power this app using WebAssembly. Combining with Mapbox.gl and deck.gl for web UI, the whole system can be running in morden (desktop and mobile) browser as a static website serving thousands users per day with a fraction cost of traditional server biased webGIS system. All media coverage are here: https://geodacenter.github.io/covid/contact.html"
