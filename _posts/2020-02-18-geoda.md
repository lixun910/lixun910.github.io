lead_text: "I am (currently) the developer and architect of GeoDa software. GeoDa is a cross-platform desktop software that serves as an introduction to spatial data analysis. The program provides a user-friendly and graphical interface to methods of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), such as spatial autocorrelation statistics for aggregate data (several thousand records), and basic spatial regression analysis. GeoDa's worldwide user numbers is over 310,000 (August 2019). This includes lab users at universities such as Harvard, MIT, and Cornell."
