lead_text: "I developed a novel scheme for automatically deriving synthetic walking (locomotion) and movement (steering and avoidance) behavior in simulation from simple trajectory samples. I use a combination of observed and recorded real‐world movement trajectory samples in conjunction with synthetic, agent‐generated, movement as inputs to a machine‐learning scheme. The potential broader applications of the scheme are numerous and include the design and delivery of location‐based services, evaluation of architectures for mobile communications technologies, what‐if experimentation in agent‐based models with hypotheses that are informed or translated from data, and the construction of algorithms for extracting and annotating space‐time paths in massive data‐sets."
