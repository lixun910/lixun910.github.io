lead_text: "GeoDa is a free, open source and cross-platform software that serves as an introduction to spatial data analysis. The program provides a user-friendly and graphical interface to methods of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), such as spatial autocorrelation statistics for aggregate data (several thousand records), and basic spatial regression analysis for point and polygon data (tens of thousands of records). GeoDa's user numbers have increased exponentially to over 300,000 (August 2019). This includes lab users at universities such as Harvard, MIT, and Cornell."
