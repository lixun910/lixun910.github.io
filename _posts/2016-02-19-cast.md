lead_text: 'I am the creator of CAST (Crime Analytics for Space and Time), which is an open-source software for analyzing crime events in a space-time framework. It is written in Python and C++. It has been assessed by the RAND Corporation: no known program offers the capabilities in CAST with a greater emphasis on temporal trends, crime analysts may find this geospatial software tool a valuable addition to their toolkits.'
