lead_text: "I developed a MapReduce algorithm for creating contiguity-based spatial weights for big geospatial data. This algorithm provides the ability to create spatial weights from very large spatial datasets efficiently by using computing resources that are organized in the Hadoop framework. It works in the paradigm of MapReduce: mappers are distributed in computing clusters to find contiguous neighbors in parallel, then reducers collect the results and generate the weights matrix. "
