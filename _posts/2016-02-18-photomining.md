lead_text: "By utilizing large amount of crowd volunteered geo-tagged photos, existing research can successfully discover landmarks or attractive areas, mine travel patterns, find classical travel routes and recommend travel destinations or routes for inexperienced tourists. By integrating new techniques in data mining and operational research, we develop a novel travel planning system to design multi-day and multi-stay travel plans based on geo-tagged photos. Specifically, a modified Iterated Local Search heuristic algorithm is developed to find an approximate optimal solution for the multi-day and multi-stay travel planning problem using points of interests (POIs) and recurrence weights between POIs in a travel graph model, which are discovered from photos"
